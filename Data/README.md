# Data (Not Included Due to Large File Size)

This folder is reserved for the sample raster datasets used in this project.  
The files listed below are **not included** in the repository because their size exceeds GitHub’s storage limits.

These rasters are generated during remote sensing based preprocessing using software QGIS 3.40.4 LTR after being downloaded from USGS Earth Explorer.

## 📁 Expected Files (Not Uploaded)

### **1. core_area_raster**
- Preprocessed Sentinel-2 MSI stack (9 bands)
- Clipped to the Reko Diq study area
- Resampled to 10 m resolution
- Input for `cnn_core.py` and `vit_core.py`

### **2. core_ratios**
- MSI + geological band ratios (iron oxide, clay, alteration indices)

### **3. core_pca_mnf**
- MSI + PCA + MNF components
- Noise-reduced feature stack

## 🔄 How to Regenerate These Files

Feature maps used in this study can be recreated using:
Script/Preprocessing.py
Software QGIS 3.40.4 LTR


1. Downloads or reads Sentinel-2 imagery  
2. Clips to the study area  
3. Computes band ratios  
4. Performs PCA and MNF  
5. Label the feature maps to mark prospective zones
