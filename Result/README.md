## 📁 Figures
These figures illustrate model behavior, component selection, and performance comparison.

### Model Performance (Accuracy Curves)
Each plot shows validation accuracy for 9 MSI bands:

- **ViT_CNN_Scratch.jpg** — Validation accuracy for scratch-trained CNN vs ViT models.
- **ViT_CNN_Augmented.jpg** — Validation accuracy for CNN vs ViT models trained with data augmentation.
- **ViT_CNN_Finetuned_Head.jpg** — Validation accuracy for the head-finetuned CNN vs ViT models.
- **ViT_CNN_Finetuned_Final.jpg** — Validation accuracy for the fully finetuned CNN vs ViT models.
- **ViT_CNN_Validation_Comparison.jpg** — All model validation accuracy experimental comparison.

### Model Comparison
- **paper_2_bar_graph.jpg** — Comparison of overall model accuracies across different model architectures & configurations (scratch, augmented, head-finetuned, fully finetuned).
